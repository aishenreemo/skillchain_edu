 	- Overall readiness of the Philippines for the implementation of K-12;

 	- Lacking school requirements (classrooms, instructional materials, qualified teachers and;

 	- Rural areas already struggle from insufficient resources under the old system.



* The primary aim for the K-12 program was to enable senior high school graduates who are unable to pursue a higher education to be employed, as well as improve readiness for employment. It also acts as a transition between secondary education and higher education.



* This poses a problem as employers prefer to hire college graduates. It is also to be noted that even before the implementation of the K-12 program, there already was a large pool of unemployed college students.



* Implementing the TESDA program proved to be effective, as students who were given a voucher by the government for pursuing technical courses were able to find jobs locally and abroad.

* Common Challenges in finding a job include:

&nbsp;	- Lack of self-confidence; Common among tech/CS grads lacking real-world project exposure, portfolio work, or internships.

&nbsp;	- Financial Pressure; Limits ability to travel for interviews or complete training, certifications, or applications.

&nbsp;	- Seeking for better job/career opportunities; Similar to CS graduates, many wait for roles that match their skills rather than accepting unrelated jobs.

&nbsp;	- Limited or no Work Experience; Mirrors challenges in CS/IT where companies often require project experience, OJT, or internships. Highlights the need for capstone projects, tech portfolios, coding labs, and industry immersion.



* It was stated by the graduates that they found their curriculum useful, however, the curriculum they are handed with needs more work in order to keep up with the GLOBAL curriculum standards. 



* The graduates also expressed their desire for more hands-on work training. The curriculum provides sufficient knowledge for their career, however, they feel lacking on the practical application of said knowledge. 



* The study suggests that technical skills alone are insufficient. There is a need to incorporate decision-making strategies and emotional resilience into the curriculum to combat the anxiety and lack of confidence new graduates face.

* This article is an analysis of the current Philippine labor market, highlighting a disconnect between the country's rapidly growing digital economy and the actual skills of its workforce.



* It is shown that there is a significant shortage of workers with advanced technical skills, and there is a critical need for such in the IT support and Cybersecurity sectors. 



* Self-Management is also in high demand for soft skills. It includes active learning, resilience, stress tolerance, and flexibility. 



* Employees are highly likely to upskill if there are accessible online courses, higher pay, and new job opportunities. They also will find it beneficial if the internet is much more up to speed.
