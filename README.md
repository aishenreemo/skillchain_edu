## 🧠 The Problem We’re Solving

Education has two major gaps:

1. **Curriculum Gap**  
   - Courses are outdated  
   - Students miss industry-relevant skills  
   - Universities can’t update syllabi fast enough  

2. **Student Skill Verification Gap**  
   - Grades ≠ real-world skills  
   - Soft skills/projects are invisible  
   - No trusted way to prove abilities  

**Our Solution:**  

- **AI Curriculum Gap Detector:** identifies missing or outdated skills in courses  
- **Web3 Student Skill Identity:** issues verifiable digital credentials for skills and achievements  

> *AI tells universities what to teach; Web3 proves what students learned.*
